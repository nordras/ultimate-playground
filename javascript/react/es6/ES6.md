# ES6

### ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to the JavaScript language standard, released in 2015

## features
- Variable Declarations (let and const): Replaced var with block-scoped keywords. let allows reassignment, while const is for values that should not change.
- Arrow Functions (=>): Provides a more concise syntax for writing functions and automatically binds the this keyword to its surrounding context.
- Classes: Introduced a cleaner, more familiar syntax for object-oriented programming, although JavaScript remains prototype-based under the hood.
- Template Literals: Uses backticks (`) to allow for easier string interpolation (embedding variables with ${}) and multi-line strings.
- Destructuring Assignment: A shorthand for extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
- Modules: Native support for organized code through import and export statements.
- Promises: A standardized system for handling asynchronous operations, helping to avoid "callback hell".
- Spread and Rest Operators (...): Used to expand arrays/objects into individual elements (Spread) or collect multiple arguments into a single array (Rest).
- New Data Structures: Introduced Map (for key-value pairs) and Set (for unique values).

## Importances
ES6 shifted the naming convention to annual releases (e.g., ES2016, ES2017) and remains the foundation for what is now called "Modern JavaScript", modern web frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue rely heavily on ES6 features. While not supported in Internet Explorer, all modern browsers have full support for ES6. Developers targeting older browsers typically use tools like Babel to convert ES6 code back to the older ES5 standard.
